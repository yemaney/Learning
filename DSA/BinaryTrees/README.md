# Binary Trees Notes:

- if you have to `travel to each leaf node`, and `keep track of of their order` then `recursive function calls are expected`
- when working recursively, `returning a special value for the lead node can be potentially useful`
- if using closures as helper functions, and they `increment or change a variable in the outside scope, check if the variable is mutable`

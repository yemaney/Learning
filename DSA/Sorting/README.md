# Sorting Notes:

- `Bubble sorting` is when you iterate over each index of an array, compare adjacent elements, and swap accordingly. Repeating the cycle until no swaps occur.
- `Insertion sorting` is when you iterate over each index of an array, and while the element at an index is less than the one before it, swap the elements. Essentially pushing each element as far back as possible.

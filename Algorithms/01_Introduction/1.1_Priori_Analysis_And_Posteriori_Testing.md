| Hardware Independent    | Hardware dependent   |
| Time and Space Function | Watch time and bytes |

## 1.2 Characteristics of Algorithms

1. Input - 0 or more
2. Output - at least one output or result
3. Definiteness - must be logical enough to program
4. Finiteness - must have a way to stop
5. Effectiveness - must serve some purpose

# Primitive Types

- Be very comfortable with the bitwise operators, particularly `XOR`
- Understand how to use `masks` and create them in an machine independent way,
- Know fast ways to clear the `lowermost` set bit (and by extension, set the lowermost 0, get its index, etc.)
- Understand `signedness` and its implications to `shifting`.
- Consider using a `cache` to accelerate operations by using it to brute-force small inputs.
- Be aware that `commutativity` and `associativity` can be used to perform operations in `parallel` and `reorder` operations.
